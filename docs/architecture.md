# Architecture

Meridian Studio is a macOS-native DAW built in layers, mirroring the
separation described in the Phase 0 design spec
(`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-16-meridian-studio-design.md`):

- **UI** (`Sources/MeridianStudioApp`) — SwiftUI views: transport,
  track list, timeline, piano roll. Depends on `ProjectModel` and
  `MIDIEngine`, never the other way around.
- **Project Model** (`Sources/ProjectModel`) — `Project`, `Track`,
  `MIDIRegion`, `NoteEvent` value types (Codable, UI-independent),
  `ProjectStore` (versioned JSON persistence), and `ProjectDocument`
  (an `UndoManager`-backed observable wrapper). No SwiftUI import.
- **MIDI Engine** (`Sources/MIDIEngine`) — `CoreMIDIInput` (hardware
  adapter), `MIDIEventQueue` (thread-safe handoff off the CoreMIDI
  callback thread), `MIDIMessageParser`/`MIDIRecorder` (pure,
  unit-tested note-pairing logic), and `PlaybackEngine`/
  `PlaybackScheduler` (AVAudioEngine-based playback).

Undo/redo is model-level scaffolding only in Phase 1: `ProjectDocument`
owns an `UndoManager` that `addRegion`/`removeRegion` register with, and
unit tests exercise undo and redo directly — but it is not wired into the
app's Edit menu or responder chain, so Cmd-Z does nothing in the running
app. Surfacing it in the UI is Phase 2 work.

Real-time safety: the CoreMIDI read callback only parses bytes and
pushes onto `MIDIEventQueue` (allocation-free after construction,
guarded by `OSAllocatedUnfairLock`, drops events rather than blocking
when full). All project-model mutation happens on the main actor, off
that callback thread.

There is no audio-recording engine, mixer, or AI layer yet — see the
roadmap in the Phase 0 spec.
